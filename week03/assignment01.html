COLLAPSE
My name is Julio Ramirez, I attend James Madison High School I'm currently a dual-credit student . My pathway is IT I'm familiar with the components of a computer, I interned at City Hall in Dallas and got the chance to fix computers for the the 911 dispatchers although I'm fascinated with computers i aspire to Major in Biology and then attend Dental School to either become a general dentist or orthodontist. The reason I'm taking this class is to know more about cybersecurty and how to protect information online whether it be for a business or personal reasons. I want to be able to identify the different types of cyber-attacks  as well.</p>
